The scope of the Farmacy Family, in the first Phase, is described in the following sub-chapters in the form of:
- targeted **Customer Segments**

# Customer Segments
The targeted Customer groups that are addressed by the Farmacy Family, are the following:
- low income families
- elderly people
- students
- first responders
- people with medical conditions

Nevertheless, the system is designed to accommodate/configure additional Customer Segments by combining the bellow Perspectives (**e.g. Income < 27000 USD AND persons in household >=5 AND Address.Home.State is Louisiana**) or any other attributes available on the Customer Profile.

| Customer Perspectives | Notes |

# Channels of Engagement
The following channels and touch-points are in scope for the **first Phase** of Farmacy Family.
Of course, the engagement channels can be extended in the future, based on analytical data/studies that reflect the customers’ behaviour in terms of healthy food.

# Engagement Customer Journey
In order for Farmacy Family to reach its objectives, as stated in previous chapters, a funnel (or multiple funnels for each customer segment) must be engineered, a funnel that reflects the **journey of a Transactional Customer to an Engaged Customer**.

- **AWARENESS**: What is my audience and how to make it aware of the brand?
- **INTEREST**: How to capture the interest of the people I have reached to?
- **CONSIDERATION**: How to convince the customer that my product best fits his/her needs?
- **PURCHASE**: How to create a convenient way for customer to buy my product?
- **RETENTION**:  How to retain the customers I’ve acquired?
- **ADVOCACY**: How can I make my customer a brand ambassador, so that brand awareness spreads within the community (back to AWARENESS funnel step)?

The Farmacy Family Solution will enable Campaign Managers to easily create and design the engaged customer journey as depicted in the above image.

Of course, the journey of each individual is not as linear as depicted above and it’s important to empower the customers to script their own journey, allowing them to choose the way they interact with the available channels and touch-points. As depicted bellow, connecting the dots within the journey will depend on each and every customer and their desired way of interaction, resulting an infinite number of journeys.
