## Deployment View ##
This is a very important View in any Solution Architecture Document and should include details regarding:
- environments and their usage
- sizing of each environment, including
  - required VMs (cores, memory, local storage)
  - required Storage (shared or associated to each VM)
  - required Network settings
- integrations matrix with 3rd party systems (port, protocol for each integration point)

The sizing of the solution should depend on a certain agreement regarding the response times of the applications in different traffic conditions.

This Deployment View is to be later detailed.
