## Quality View

The following architectural characteristics (in priority order) were considered when the solution was designed:

| Acrhitectural Characteristic | Definition | Approach |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Security** | “Degree the software protects information and data so that people or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization.”</br>[Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) by Mark Richards & Neal Ford | |
| **Usability** | “Level of training required for users to achieve their goals with the application/solution.”</br>[Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) by Mark Richards & Neal Ford | |
| **Data Integrity & Data Consistency** |Ability to maintain and assure data accuracy and consistency; prevent unauthorized access to or modification of data | | |
| **Interoperability** | How easily the solution can exchange information/data with other systems | 
| **Scalability** | “Ability for the system to perform and operate as the number of users or requests increases.“</br>[Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) by Mark Richards & Neal Ford | |
| **Configurability** | “Ability for the end-users to easily change aspects of the software’s configuration (through usable interfaces).”</br>[Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) by Mark Richards & Neal Ford | |s
