## Quality View

The following architectural characteristics (in priority order) were considered when the solution was designed:

| Acrhitectural Characteristic | Definition | Approach |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Security** | “Degree the software protects information and data so that people or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization.”</br>[Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) by Mark Richards & Neal Ford | <ul><li>Farmacy Family uses a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution which offers centralized access control and authorization</li><li>Secured communication channels between all subsystems and modules</li><li>Being an AWS based solution, **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance** is ensured for a significant number of services:<ul><li>https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/</li><li>List of AWS services HIPAA compliant: https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/</li></ul></li></ul> |
| **Usability** | “Level of training required for users to achieve their goals with the application/solution.”</br>[Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) by Mark Richards & Neal Ford | <ul><li>The User Experience (UX) consistency among the different applications helps to reduce the learning curve</li><li>Farmacy Family offers a set of training videos for the Engaged Customers for How-To use the different available features e.g. how to access the Forum, how to search the Media Library, etc.</li></ul> |
| **Data Integrity & Data Consistency** |Ability to maintain and assure data accuracy and consistency; prevent unauthorized access to or modification of data | <ul><li>The FamilyFarmacy Event Data Consumers have as objective to process and clean-up the incoming data (in form of event data) so that data remains accurate.</li><li>The current approach is to use relational databases which ensure consistency by definition.</li><li>Unauthorized access is prevented at different levels:<ul><li>by Amazon itself (as a cloud provider)</li><li>by the solution itself which uses AWS IAM to ensure authorization is in place so that incoming requests are checked for whether they should be allowed or not to access/modify a certain resource.</li></ul></li></ul> |
| **Interoperability** | How easily the solution can exchange information/data with other systems | <ul><li>Communication via Events & Messaging Queues</li><li>API layer for Family Farmacy platform </li></ul> |
| **Scalability** | “Ability for the system to perform and operate as the number of users or requests increases.“</br>[Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) by Mark Richards & Neal Ford | |
| **Configurability** | “Ability for the end-users to easily change aspects of the software’s configuration (through usable interfaces).”</br>[Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/) by Mark Richards & Neal Ford | |s
